    [00:49.08] Did we deserve this?
    [00:53.22] You're here to serve
    [00:55.15] Daddy please!
    [00:56.96] We all scream for ice cream
    [00:59.91] This machine
    [01:01.15] Will help with the brain freeze
    [01:04.36] The stage lights up with controlled shocks
    [01:08.93] So tighten up all your spring locks
    [01:13.38] Through the vent
    [01:15.05] Keeping your composure

    [00:15.31] It was just two lovers, sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde
    [00:18.83] Fallin' for each other, pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
    [00:23.27] No Donald Glover, missed call from my mother
    [00:26.75] Like, "Where you at tonight?" Got no alibi
    [00:28.82] I was all alone with the love of my life
    [00:33.72] She's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night
    [00:40.88] I don't need no light to see you
    [00:46.09] Shine
    [00:50.10] It's your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)
    [00:58.43] You slow down time
    [01:05.16] In your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)
    [01:16.56] We were just two lovers, feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
    [01:20.30] Burnin' through the summer, radio on blast, make the moment last
    [01:24.22] She got solar power, minutes feel like hours
    [01:27.98] She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine
    [01:29.98] Fallin' like I did for the love of my life?
    [01:34.86] She's got glow on her face, a glorious look in her eyes
    [01:42.03] My angel of light
    [01:45.13] I was all alone with the love of my life
    [01:50.14] She's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night
    [01:57.27] I don't need no light to see you
    [02:02.35] Shine
    [02:06.19] It's your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)
    [02:14.68] You slow down time
    [02:21.33] In your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)

  [00:24.95]It doesn't hurt me
  [00:27.98]Do you want to feel how it feels?

  [01:25.74]But see how deep the bullet lies
  [01:29.99]Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
  [01:34.24]Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts
  [01:39.01]Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
